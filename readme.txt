                FAQ
                ===

  Q: How do I log in to my account?

A: You use the credentials I gave you 
when your machine was set up. 

                -*-

  Q: I just paid and got a confirmation 
but I haven't heard from you. What 
happens now?

A: I need to wake up and get to your 
Stripe payment email. I'm only a 
one-man-band at the moment, so I will 
get to your new subscription as fast as
I can. I'll reach out to you, and we'll 
set up your machine.

                -*-

  Q: How long does my machine take to 
set up?

A: It's all manual right now, so I will 
contact you as soon as I get email 
confirmation of your subscription from
Stripe, and I'll set it up for you in
consultation with you from there.

                -*-

  Q: What kind of options can I 
customize in my browser and machine?

A: I can set up a machine in a GCP 
region that's as close to you as 
possible to optimize latency. I'm also
happy to customize the theme of the
browser, but depending on complexity
I may need to take time or give you a 
quote.

                -*-

  Q: What kind of other features can you
build for me? 

A: I'm happy to entertain your ideas
and discuss with you about what's 
possible, but it's likely that many
features may require a lot of work that 
I would invoice you for.

                -*-

  Q: Where is your company based?

A: The Dosyago Corporation is a US
based Delaware C corporation.

Q: Who are you?
A: I'm Cris Stringfellow, I have a 
GitHub profile you may be interested in
looking at:
